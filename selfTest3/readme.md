Exercise (part I):

Today we will define a class called Purse to simulate a bag with coins in it.  We want to be able to add coins to a Purse, get the total value of the coins in a Purse, and to get a String representation of a Purse (a String object indicating how many of each coin denomination are contained in the purse and their total value).  To simplify the problem, we will have only 1-cent, 10-cent, 50-cent, and 1-euro coins in a Purse.
